# weatherau
A basic statistical analysis of weather data in PowerBI. This exercise was intended as a self-directed introduction into PowerBI's DAX and MySQL in order to further technical abilities and improve familiarity with MS PowerBI and MySQL.

The analysis was required to find the following:

**Goal 1**: Identify, for the records found within Victoria, the times/dates at which rainfall were the highest,
and, at what temperature rainfall is most likely to fall.

**Goal 2**: Identify which state has the highest accumlative rainfall each year.

**Goal 3**: Identify possible relationships between rainfall amount to humidity and atmospheric pressure.

Data was sourced from Kaggle via the following link:

## Analysis and Findings
Analysis of weather data sourced from Kaggle identified that, within Victoria, Victorian rainfall averaged around 17.3mm between the observation period of 2008 to 2017.

Further, a maxmimum of 516.2mm of average rainfall (calculated by day) was identified on the 5th of February 2011.
