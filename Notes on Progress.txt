It is important to establish a basic goal. This goal will be followed for the statistical analysis.

Goal 1: Identify, for the records found within Victoria, the times/dates at which rainfall were the highest,
and, at what temperature rainfall is most likely to fall.

Goal 2: Identify which state has the highest accumlative rainfall each year.

Goal 3: Identify possible relationships between rainfall amount to humidity and atmospheric pressure.

Goal 4: Update the GitHub page description to show results, and discuss limitations and what was learnt. (Reflection)

==================================
Notes:

Initial setting up Git, and GitHub.
- Proceeded with no particular hiccups.

GOAL 1: Identifying Victorian Rainfall data and basic statistical analysis.
- Successfully imported data (.csv format) into PowerBI, however PowerBI picked up on some errors with dataset. Likely relating to formatting issues of data.
- Therefore, analysis of data will not be possible at this stage given differences in data types, as some columns are stored as Text (and I require the dataset to be numerical in order to calculate formulas). It seems a conversion in PowerBI doesn't seem to work.
- Loading into MySQL to attempt to data clean.
- Upon loading into MySQL and changing the connection from PowerBI to the MySQL localhost server instead of direct to the .csv, it seemed to have fixed a majority of formatting/data type issues.
- Will keep an eye out and investigate further but for now will presently analyse data as is.
- Noted that issue with data types still persisted as there were some missing records in the weather station data. Upon closer inspection, it seemed that (based on a data point count) records for rainfall data were implemented during the 2008 and 2017 period.
	- Accordingly, there were some rows in the Rainfall data that were listed as text "NA", which were required to be resolved. I could have used SQL to rectify the issue, but it was a lighterweight issue that was rectified in PowerQuery. I replaced all NA values with null to represent missing data.
- Data type issue resolved for Rainfall data. Column data type changed to numerical decimal numbers.
- Successfully displayed average rainfall records over entire 2008-2017 period. Successfully identified average rainfall figures, maximal figure and date figure with Visual filters.
- Confidence interval bounds were established to determine in what range rainfall is likely to occur to a 95% confidence level.

GOAL 2:
- Identifying which state had the highest accumalated rainfall requires modifying the "State" column.
- Basic overview completed identifying highest rainfall state.
- Utilised visual filters to identify highest rainfall states by year

GOAL 3:
- Noted a significant amount of missing data points regarding atmospheric pressure. Perhaps this is related to locational limitations or equipment limitations?
- Summarised the data of rainfall against humidity and pressure. Noted that there was a normal distribution of Pressure to Rainfall events and right-skewed distribution of Humidity to Rainfall events.
- Created datapoint and count of day summary buttons.

GOAL 4:
- Updated GitHub and discussed findings, limitations and reflections. END.
