Initial setting up Git, and GitHub.
- Proceeded with no particular hiccups.

Statistical Analysis of Weather Data in PowerBI
- Successfully imported data (.csv format) into PowerBI, however PowerBI picked up on some errors with dataset. Likely relating to formatting issues of data.
- Therefore, analysis of data will not be possible at this stage given differences in data types, as some columns are stored as Text (and I require the dataset to be numerical in order to calculate formulas). It seems a conversion in PowerBI doesn't seem to work.
- Loading into MySQL to attempt to data clean.
- Upon loading into MySQL and changing the connection from PowerBI to the MySQL localhost server instead of direct to the .csv, it seemed to have fixed a majority of formatting/data type issues.
- Will keep an eye out and investigate further but for now will presently analyse data as is.
